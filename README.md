# LlanOS - Experimental OS Kernel
---

### Description

LlanOS is an experimental OS kernel written for the purpose of learning OS kernel development from scratch. This project has two functional goals: Build a scheduler that can manage multiple CPUs and build in memory managment that utilizes an MMU.

During the development of this kernel, it is expected that TDD (Test Driven Development) be used for any implemented feature. This software methodology will encourage better code writing, encourage the use of more documentation, and encourage a more functional programming style (try to avoid as much internal source code states as possible).

Additional goals for this project is to implement an easy to understand, easily modifiable, and generic makefile system for the project. A linter will be implemented to inspect coding style and run some static analysis.
